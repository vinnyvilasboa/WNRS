# STEP 2 GAME PLAY





# /// Thoughts :

 I'm going to need to make multiple pages with similar layouts. How do i connect it through the next button? 

 4/27/21 - Do i want to make it webpage and mobile responsive as well? I think it's better for me to the make it webpage and add a media query for whatever mobile devices you know? 

so following that logic i'm going to duplicate the page from the original HTML, see what i want to maintain the same. Like the color, and centering. **How do i make all elements centered so i dont have to do it one by one?**
